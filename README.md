# conflict-resolution
In this activity, we will walk through a situation to learn about merge conflicts and how to handle them using Git and GitHub. Merge conflicts arise when one version of your project looks one way and another version looks slightly different, causing Git to prompt you to address and confirm which version is correct so that you can move on.

# replace the last value with the one you copied from your GitHub repository
git clone git@github.com:lernantino/conflict-resolution.git
